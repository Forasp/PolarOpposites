# Giskard


## About

Giskard is a Mac-only game editor. The intent is to build Giskard in Swift and  Xcode, and to handle scripting and UI layout with LuaJIT and XML.

## Goals

- UI and editor logic defined via LuaJIT scripting and XML layouts.
- Native macOS support.
- Modular structure for future engine and tool development.

## Planned Features

- Editor UI driven by LuaJIT scripts.
- XML-based UI layout and component definitions.
- Hot-reload support for UI and scripting.
- Scene and asset management.
- Property panels and inspectors.
- Extensible for future modules (rendering, physics, etc.).

## Roadmap

1. Project setup in Swift and Xcode.
2. Integrate LuaJIT runtime.
3. Design XML schema for UI layouts.
4. Add Lua scripting integration for UI logic.
5. Implement core editor features (scene/file management, property inspector, asset pipeline).
